    Format a Snakemake log dictionary into a Loki-compatible JSON payload.

    - Auto-detects total job count from Snakemake 'Job stats' or 'X of Y steps' logs.
    - Tracks completed jobs via 'Finished jobid' messages.
    - Calculates accurate progress percentage based on detected real totals.
    - Extracts Project ID from log messages.
